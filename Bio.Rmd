 _In 2015, I was the youngest ever to defend a doctorate thesis in Forest_
 _Resource Science and Technology in the history of the University of_
 _Helsinki (HY). My doctoral dissertation dealt with physically based_
 _vegetation remote sensing, focusing on developing ground reference_
 _methods and validating different global satellite-based vegetation_
 _products in a boreal region. After I completed my doctoral dissertation,_
 _I had short research visit in USA (Duke university). Following 1.5-yr I_
 _continued to work at the HY, during which I extended my expertise into_
 _processing and applying airborne laser scanning data for quantifying_
 _forest canopy structures. During my years in HY, I participated in_
 _teaching remote sensing courses and leading GIS-practicals. Autumn 2016_
 _I received postdoc position from the NIBIO (Norwegian Institute of_
 _Bioeconomy research), in a project that targeted towards developing_
 _methods for accounting forest management impacts in different land_
 _surface model (LSM) simulations employing prescribed landcover_
 _information. I developed a forest classification scheme and related_
 _landcover product for enhancing the description of managed Fennoscandic_
 _forests in different LSMs using Scandinavian forest inventory data. In_
 _addition, I refined the 'time invariant optical properties'-table that_
 _is used in LSM. Currently, I am working with landcover classification_
 _and vegetation phenology topics._
